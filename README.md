#####What is JavaGame?
JavaGame is a game project that have been working on since May 2013. I have added many features to the game over the last year and I plan on adding even more features. This game is purely for my own sake to practice my skills in Java.

#####Why name it JavaGame?
Well i'm still not sure what exactly i'm going to do with it, and I haven't thought of a suitable name either. I hope to change the name in the near future
